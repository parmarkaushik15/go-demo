1. Approximate Time Frame for Completing the Exercise:
CSV File Ingestion and Queue: 2 hours
Message Processing and Storage (PostgreSQL + Redis): 2 hours
API Development (GET with filters): 1 hours
Testing & Documentation: 1 hours
Setup DevOPS: 2 hours

Total Time: 8 hours

2. Assessment of the Test's Difficulty:
Difficulty: Moderate
Explanation:  This test involves working with multiple technologiesâ€”RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Golang. The difficulty arises in integrating these systems seamlessly. The CSV ingestion and RabbitMQ messaging are straightforward, but managing message processing to interact with both PostgreSQL and Redis efficiently can get complex, especially when ensuring high performance. The API development with query filters adds a layer of complexity in handling different use cases. However, the task is not extremely difficult for someone familiar with these technologies, especially if there is experience in building backend systems using Golang.
